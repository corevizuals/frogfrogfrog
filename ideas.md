Title: Hungry Hungry Frogs - Ideas

Description:
Hungry Hungry Frogs is an interactive, arcade-style game where the user has control of a frog that must "eat" moving targets (flies) to gain points while competing with other automated frogs. The goal is to consume as many flies (20) to win the game.

Inspiration:
Inspired by Hungry Hungry Hippos, this game combines timing and coordination to create a fun and challenging experience.

Core Concepts:

Player Control: Players control a frog using keyboard/mouse inputs.
Flies: Flies move across the screen, requiring the player to move and interact with them.
Scoring System: Each fly eaten by the frog adds points to the score.
Time Limit/Objective: The game has a target score (20) as a goal, encouraging the player to collect as many points as possible within the limit.


Potential Features I could expand on:

Multiplayer (for more than one frog)
Power-ups (e.g., temporary speed boost, larger mouth)
Random obstacles (e.g., harmful bugs that reduce points) *note i never ended finding time to implement these features.
